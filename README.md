# Drag drop from sidebar

In of the projects I'm working on I needed to include a drag and drop feature from a sidebar item to grid using React. Of the components found was used React-grid-layout with Toolbox example.
After studying component and applied to the project I realised I needed extra functionality such as drag an item from the sidebar to the grid.

I found the gridstack.js plugin developed in Jquery and although I donâ€™t like to mix react with Jquery I decided to use it for its resources.

In this tutorial I will explain my experience creating a drag and drop prototype where it is drag item from sidebar to grid and remove items from grid or sidebar.

The first step is necessary install the dependencies and set up the webpack.

Dependencies used:

-   gridstack
-   bootstrap
-   jquery
-   jquery-ui

```
npm install gridstack bootstrap jquery jquery-ui
```

After it has got unzip the webpack from react for set up jquery-ui

```
npm run eject
```

Open webpack.config.dev.js file into config folder and you go to line where you find alias and you add the follow instruct:

```
'jquery-ui': 'jquery-ui/ui'
```
